Music Generation Project I made in HS w/ Java. I have played piano for 10+ years and wanted to combine that passion with a cs project. I wrote this senior year 2022 when I was learning more about Java. 

I used my music knowledge to genarate pretty chord structures, with random notes. I also created the gui by drawing with acm graphics, which I learned in class. 

It was a good exersize to create different classes for all the musical objects, like beats, rests and more. Measures had the capacity to include multiple melodic notes as well as base notes.
